# ChatterKB Website
This is the source for [ChatterKB's website](https://chatterkb.com).

It lets me use Bootstrap for styling while leveraging the Jekyll static site generator to break down the site into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Why is this important?

Because I need to be able to create offers and landing pages without having to worry about the site's structure.

I keep the site public so that you can learn from it.
